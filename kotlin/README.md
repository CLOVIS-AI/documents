Kotlin is a statically and strongly-typed language, mostly OO but with many functional functionalities, allowing you to use the best part of different paradigms in the different parts of your project. Kotlin is multiplatform, and can be used for desktop applications (Linux, Windows, MacOS) on the JVM, for Android, for websites (by transpiling to JS), and for iOS via LLVM.

This course will teach you the basics of programming, using Kotlin. By its end, you will understand what this introduction meant.
