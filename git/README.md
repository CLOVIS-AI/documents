# Git documents

Unlike many Git tutorials, which are written to teach you as little as possible, so you can start working soon, this tutorial aims to give you a understanding of what is going on behind the scenes.

Git is a very powerful tool, which makes it easy to choose an easy, but bad solution.

The goal of this guide is to teach you what a 'good' solution is. This way, you will make fewer mistakes, and will be able to troubleshoot better.

> Most guides will teach you how to use the basic features of Git.
> We will teach you how to understand what goes wrong, and how to fix it.

Of course, this means that there will be more to learn, instead of just copy-pasting commands and hoping for the best.

## Table of contents

##### Level 3. Extras

This level is entirely unnecessary, it is simply to show off some neat parts of Git. When you're good with everything from Level 2, we encourage you to skim through this level, so you get an idea of what is possibleâ€”and if one day you're interested, you know where to find more info.
